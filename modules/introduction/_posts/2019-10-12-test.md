Unstructured invoices
=====================
Unstructured invoices are images or documents which a human user can understand but a computer 
would not know that the payable amount is e.g. 596.21 â‚¬ when in the document you only write 
Endbetrag: 596,21 Eur

Structured invoices
===================
Structured invoices describe in a machine readable way, e.g. in XML, 

```
<payableamount currency="EUR">596.21</payableamount>
```

Hybrid invoices
===============
Hybrid invoices usually combine a human readable part, e.g. a PDF file, with a machine readable e-invoice,
e.g. a embedded XML file.
